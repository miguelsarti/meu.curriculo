<p>What is Lorem Ipsum? <br>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br>It has survived not only five centuries, <br> but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <br> remaining essentially unchanged. <br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, <br>and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
